## My Graduation project repo (currently under development)

# Speed estimation using roadside camera and machine vision

## Getting started

Note that CUDA should be installed for optimal performance for Deep Learning models.

Please see the following github repo, since YOLOv3 model implementation was retrieved from it:
https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3

Clone and install requierements:
```
git clone https://github.com/hector6298/titulacion_vehice_speed_estimation
cd titulacion_vehice_speed_estimation
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Download YOLO weights:
```
cd yolov3/weights
bash download_weights.sh
```
